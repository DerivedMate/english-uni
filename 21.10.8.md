# Talks

Both talks highlight the outdated nature of the education system - a relict of the bygone era of industrializm, favouring human utilitarianism above all else (hierarchy of subjects; equating not going to collage to wasting one's life - fireman anecdote), as well as critique the cookie-cutter nature of it - hindering one's ability to flourish in their respective fields. As an alternative, the two insist on more bespoke, and diverse approaches to education.
